//Rectangle is in the java.awt package.
//I can import it by using import java.awt.Rectangle; After, I can make a Rectangle object like Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
//Rectangle has several constructors, including the no-argument one and others that take width, height, or coordinates.
//The error is that translate expects two integers, but Hello is a string So the second argument should be an int.
